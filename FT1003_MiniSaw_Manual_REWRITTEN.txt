• 10-14 TPI: For PVC, acrylic, and other plastics


================================================================================
BLADE ORIENTATION - TWO CUTTING MODES
================================================================================

Your Freedom Mini Saw can cut in two different orientations:


FORWARD MODE (Standard)
-----------------------
Blade teeth face FORWARD, away from the saw body.

Use for:
• Most cutting applications
• Cutting boards and lumber
• General purpose work
• Maximum visibility of cut line


BACKWARD MODE (Inverted)
------------------------
Blade teeth face DOWNWARD, toward the base plate.

Use for:
• Flush cutting against walls or floors
• Cutting in tight spaces
• Reducing tear-out on top surface
• Cutting close to obstacles

To switch modes: Simply remove the blade and reinstall it in the opposite 
orientation.


================================================================================
OPERATING YOUR MINI SAW
================================================================================

STARTING THE SAW
----------------

This saw has a two-step safety system to prevent accidental starting:

1. Press the LOCK-OFF BUTTON on either side of the handle.

2. While holding the lock-off button, squeeze the TRIGGER.

3. The saw will start running.

4. Once running, you can release the lock-off button. The saw will continue 
   running as long as you hold the trigger.

5. To stop: Release the trigger.

⚠ There is NO lock-on feature. You must hold the trigger to keep the saw 
running.


VARIABLE SPEED CONTROL
----------------------

The trigger is variable speed:
• Squeeze lightly = Slower cutting speed
• Squeeze fully = Maximum cutting speed (2,100 SPM)

Use slower speeds for:
• Starting cuts
• Cutting metal
• Cutting curves
• Better control

Use maximum speed for:
• Straight cuts in wood
• Cutting plastic
• Faster material removal


================================================================================
CUTTING TECHNIQUES
================================================================================

GENERAL CUTTING PROCEDURE
--------------------------

1. Mark your cut line clearly with a pencil.

2. Secure the workpiece firmly with clamps. Make sure the cut area overhangs 
   the work surface so the blade won't hit the table.

3. Install the appropriate blade for your material.

4. Put on safety glasses, dust mask, and hearing protection.

5. Install the battery.

6. Position the base plate firmly against the workpiece.

7. Align the blade with your cut line (don't touch the material yet).

8. Start the saw and let it reach full speed.

9. Slowly guide the saw forward into the material. Let the blade do the work - 
   don't force it.

10. Keep the base plate flat against the workpiece throughout the cut.

11. At the end of the cut, release the trigger before lifting the saw away.


CUTTING WOOD
------------

BLADE RECOMMENDATION: 10 TPI or higher, thin kerf blade

TECHNIQUE:
• Secure the wood with clamps
• Place the base plate firmly against the wood
• Start the saw before touching the wood
• Use steady, even pressure
• Don't force the saw - let the blade cut at its own pace
• For thick wood, use a slower feed rate

PREVENTING TEAR-OUT:
• Cut with the "good" side facing down
• Use a fine-tooth blade (14+ TPI)
• Apply masking tape along the cut line
• Use backward blade orientation for less tear-out on top

CUTTING CURVES:
• Use a narrow blade designed for curves
• Cut slowly and carefully
• Don't twist the blade - make relief cuts if necessary


TREE TRIMMING AND PRUNING
--------------------------

BLADE RECOMMENDATION: 6-10 TPI wood cutting blade

TECHNIQUE:
• Hold the base plate firmly against the branch
• Cut as close to the trunk as possible to minimize branch movement
• For thick branches, make a relief cut on the underside first to prevent 
  bark tearing
• Be aware of branch tension - it may pinch the blade
• Never cut branches above your head
• Watch for falling branches

⚠ SAFETY: Wear safety glasses, gloves, and a hard hat when trimming trees.


CUTTING METAL
-------------

BLADE RECOMMENDATION: 18-24 TPI bi-metal blade

TECHNIQUE:
• Secure the metal firmly - it must not vibrate
• Use a slower cutting speed
• Apply light, steady pressure
• Don't force the blade - this reduces blade life and can cause breakage
• Let the blade cool periodically on long cuts

CUTTING THIN SHEET METAL:
• Clamp thin plywood underneath the metal
• This prevents vibration and tearing
• Produces a cleaner cut

CUTTING METAL PIPE:
• DON'T cut straight through like wood
• Instead, cut around the circumference of the pipe
• Only one section of the blade should contact the pipe at a time
• This prevents blade pinching

LUBRICATION:
• Apply a thin film of cutting oil along the cut line
• This makes cutting easier and extends blade life
• For aluminum, use kerosene instead of oil


CUTTING PLASTIC
---------------

BLADE RECOMMENDATION: 10-14 TPI blade

TECHNIQUE:
• Secure the plastic firmly
• Use medium speed
• Apply light pressure
• Cut slowly to prevent melting from friction heat
• Let the blade cool if you notice melting

TYPES OF PLASTIC:
• PVC pipe: Use wood-cutting blade, medium speed
• Acrylic: Use fine-tooth blade, slow speed to prevent cracking
• Polycarbonate: Use fine-tooth blade, slow speed


FLUSH CUTTING
-------------

For cutting close to walls, floors, or other surfaces:

1. Install the blade in BACKWARD MODE (teeth facing down).

2. Position the base plate flat against the surface.

3. Guide the saw carefully along the surface.

4. The blade will cut flush with the surface.

APPLICATIONS:
• Cutting off door jambs for flooring installation
• Trimming PVC pipes flush with walls
• Cutting cable ducts against floors or ceilings
• Removing protruding nails or screws


================================================================================
