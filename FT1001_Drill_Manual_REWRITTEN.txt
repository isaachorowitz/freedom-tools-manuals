OPERATING YOUR DRILL
================================================================================

INSTALLING DRILL BITS OR SCREWDRIVER BITS
------------------------------------------

1. Make sure the battery is removed.

2. Hold the back section of the chuck (the part closest to the drill body).

3. Rotate the front section of the chuck counterclockwise to open the jaws.

4. Insert the drill bit or screwdriver bit as far as possible into the chuck.
   • For screwdriver bits, use a bit holder/adapter
   • Choose the correct bit size to avoid damaging screws

5. Tighten the chuck by rotating the front section clockwise. Tighten firmly 
   by hand.

6. Check that the bit is secure by trying to pull it out.


SELECTING DRILL SPEED (1 OR 2)
-------------------------------

Your drill has two speed ranges:

• SPEED 1 (LOW): 0-350 RPM
  Use for: Driving screws, drilling large holes, drilling metal

• SPEED 2 (HIGH): 0-1300 RPM
  Use for: Drilling small holes in wood, drilling plastic

To change speeds: Slide the speed selector switch to position 1 or 2.

⚠ ONLY change speeds when the drill is completely stopped!


SETTING THE TORQUE (CLUTCH)
----------------------------

The torque ring controls how much twisting force the drill applies. This 
prevents over-tightening screws and stripping screw heads.

Numbers 1-17: Use for driving screws
• Start with 1 (lowest torque) and increase if needed
• Higher numbers = more force
• The clutch will "click" when the set torque is reached

Drill Symbol: Use for drilling holes
• This setting provides maximum power
• The clutch is disengaged


FORWARD AND REVERSE
-------------------

The forward/reverse switch controls rotation direction:

• FORWARD (clockwise): For drilling holes and driving screws
• REVERSE (counterclockwise): For removing screws and backing out jammed bits

The switch shows directional arrows:
• → = Forward
• ← = Reverse

⚠ ONLY change direction when the drill is completely stopped!


TURNING THE DRILL ON AND OFF
-----------------------------

TO START:
• Squeeze the trigger

TO STOP:
• Release the trigger

VARIABLE SPEED CONTROL:
• Squeeze lightly = Slow speed
• Squeeze harder = Faster speed

This gives you precise control for starting holes and driving screws.


LED WORK LIGHT
--------------

The LED work light automatically turns on when you squeeze the trigger. This 
illuminates your work area for better visibility.


================================================================================
USING YOUR DRILL
================================================================================

DRILLING HOLES
--------------

1. Select the correct drill bit for your material:
   • Wood: Brad point or twist drill bits
   • Metal: High-speed steel (HSS) twist bits
   • Masonry: Carbide-tipped masonry bits
   • Plastic: Standard twist bits

2. Mark your drilling location with a pencil or center punch.

3. Set the torque ring to the drill symbol position.

4. Select the appropriate speed:
   • Large holes or metal: Speed 1 (low)
   • Small holes or wood: Speed 2 (high)

5. Position the bit at the mark and squeeze the trigger slowly to start.

6. Apply steady, moderate pressure. Let the drill do the work - don't force it.

7. For deep holes, periodically pull the bit out to clear chips.

IF THE BIT GETS JAMMED:
• Release the trigger immediately
• Switch to reverse
• Use low speed to back the bit out
• Don't force it - this can damage the bit or drill


DRIVING SCREWS
--------------

1. Select the correct screwdriver bit for your screw type:
   • Phillips head: Use Phillips bit (#1, #2, or #3)
   • Flat head: Use flat blade bit
   • Square drive: Use Robertson bit
   • Star: Use Torx bit

2. Insert the bit into a bit holder/adapter, then into the chuck.

3. Set the torque ring to 1 (lowest setting).

4. Select Speed 1 (low speed).

5. Set the forward/reverse switch to forward (→).

6. Position the bit squarely in the screw head.

7. Hold the drill straight and apply steady pressure while squeezing the 
   trigger.

8. If the screw isn't fully seated and the clutch clicks, increase the torque 
   setting and try again.

TIPS FOR DRIVING SCREWS:
• Pre-drill pilot holes in hardwood to prevent splitting
• Keep the bit pressed firmly into the screw head to prevent stripping
• Use steady, even pressure
• Don't over-tighten - this can strip threads or break screw heads


REMOVING SCREWS
---------------

1. Insert the correct screwdriver bit.

2. Set the torque ring to a medium setting (8-12).

3. Set the forward/reverse switch to reverse (←).

4. Position the bit squarely in the screw head.

5. Hold the drill straight and apply firm pressure while squeezing the trigger.

6. If the screw is stuck, try:
   • Increasing the torque setting
   • Applying penetrating oil and waiting a few minutes
   • Using an impact driver instead
